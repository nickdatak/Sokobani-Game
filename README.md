**Sokobani Game**
*Using Java*

**About**
This project is a Java implementation of the classic Sokoban puzzle game, called Sokobani in this course. The player pushes boxes onto designated target tiles within a confined grid-based level. Walls block movement, and boxes can only be pushed (not pulled), one at a time. The game evolves from a simple console-based text output version into a graphical version using JavaFX as part of a progressive course on object-oriented programming.
